Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tito, a data engineer from Nairobi, Kenya. I'm comfortable working with Python, Scala, SQL and big data tools and technologies such as Databricks, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, and Nifi. I'm currently learning machine learning operations (MLOPS).


You can find some of my code [here](https://github.com/TitoLulu/)
